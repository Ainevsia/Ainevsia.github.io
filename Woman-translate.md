# 一个女人是这样衰老的


## 1

When I was twenty, walked around the campus in a vested denim skirt, my face flushed as my mouth open.

Now I am thirty, sitting in my office and scolding my subordinates, crulty written on my face, "How can you dare to ask such a silly question before even making a draft?"

>二十岁的时候，我穿着一条背心式牛仔裙在校园里走来走去，一说话就脸红。

>三十岁的我穿着名牌套装，坐在办公桌前，满脸冷酷地对下属说：“这么愚蠢的问题你也敢问？也不先打个草稿。”

When I was twenty, the books borrowed from the library were *The Complete Works of Shakespeare*, *Self-portrait of a young artist* and *Ulysses*.

Now I am in my thirties, on the bedside table lays * The scrects of following the banker*, *ELLE* and *A manager's personal charm*.

>二十岁的时候，从图书馆借的是《莎士比亚全集》、《一个青年艺术家的自画像》和《尤里西斯》。

>三十岁之后，床头摆的是《跟庄密笈》、《ELLE》和《经理人的个人魅力》.

In the summer of my twenty, met the boy I crushed who was said to be admitted to a graduate school. Dismayed by the progress he had made, my heart torn with grief and my tears droped as it occured to me that it was beyond my whole life to become elegent enough so that he could gave me a glance.

After thirty, searching everywhere for a bought MBA.

>二十岁的暑假，在家乡的大街上偶遇自己的暗恋对象，听说他考上了研究生，被他的进步所打击，心如刀绞，想到这辈子终于不能出色得让他看我一眼，不禁怅然泪下。

>三十岁之后，到处打听那里可以花钱买个MBA.

## 4

In my twenty, indicating my age from time to time, even before they asked.

After thirty, find it an odious thing when asked about age. If you do, "have a guess".

>二十岁的时候，随时随地向人透露我的年龄，答得比问的还快。

>三十岁之后，最恨别人问年龄，你要是非问不可，你猜啊。

## 5

In my twenty, overwhelmed with the idea to date with boys majoring in sports or arts.

After thirty, regard myself then as an idiot.

>二十岁的时候，一心想和体育系、美术系的男生约会。

>三十岁后，我简直认为自己当年是白痴。

## 6

In my twenty, saw a bookstore and went in, have books there and bought.

After thirty, turn a blind eye to bookstores and directly went into the Beauty Salon next door.

>二十岁的时候，有书店必须逛，有书必买。

>三十岁之后，对书店视而不见，直接去了隔壁的美容院。

## 7

In my twenty, bet on myself that I wasn't as outdated as defending this place till dead. Live elsewhere.

After thirty, run out of my legs for a house in this city that I satisfied and can afford.

>二十岁的时候，打赌说我这辈子不可能土到死守在一个地方，生活在别处嘛。

>三十岁之后，我为了在这座城市买个满意又便宜的房子跑断了双腿.

## 8

In my twenty, went to a movie with someone at night. Hand in hand without conscious which made me happy for a whole summer.

After thirty, sitting in the revolving restaurant of Shangri-La Hotel to accompany clients and eat self help meals. As the restaurant rotates slowly, I feels an unknow inanity and suddenly grows boring toward the whole world.

>二十岁的时候，和某个人晚上一起去看了场电影，不经意中拉了一次手，结果幸福了整整一个夏天。

>三十岁之后，坐在香格里拉酒店的旋转餐厅陪客户吃自主助餐，在缓缓的转动之中，莫名其妙地一阵空虚，突然间对一切感到索然无味
